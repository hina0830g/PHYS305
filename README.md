# PHYS305 final project -simulation of WASP75b-
Codes used in the final project for computational physics, PHYS305 at the University of Arizona.
This project is used to calculate the properties and study the motion of exoplanet WASP75b using transit method. It produces light curve of the host star WASP75
and executes calculations on the light curve to find basic properties of the exoplanet such as the radius, orbital period and semi-major axis. 
It solves orbital mechanics using verlet method and creates animations that simulate the motion of the exoplanet from 2 different angles. Animations include upper and side view of the transit, as well as the light curve with a moving marker.
